    "\n",
    "This project is from Udacity's Data Wrangling course, which is part of the Data Analyst Nanodegree program. The goal is practice data wrangling, i.e. to use Python and its libraries to gather data from various sources of different formats, assess its quality and tidiness, and then clean this data. Additionally, we will analyze and report on our findings. These efforts will be documented in this Jupyter Notebook.\n",

    "The steps include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gathering data\n",
    "- Assessing this data\n",
    "- Cleaning it\n",
    "- Storing, analyzing, and visualizing the wrangled data\n",

    "We will download a twitter archive and supplement it with additional data. As per to the Udacity course materials:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The dataset that we will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because \"they're good dogs Brent.\" WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "> WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017."

    "There are a number of issues that we can see right away:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `in_reply_to_status_id`, `in_reply_to_user_id`, `retweeted_status_id`, `retweeted_status_user_id`, `retweeted_status_timestamp` columns all appear to contain many null (NaN) values. If a value is present in any of these columns, it indicates that the tweet is actually a reply (the first two) or a retweet (the last three). Because one of our requirements is that \"we only want original ratings (no retweets)\", we should remove any rows that have non-null values in any of these columns. Aftward, we can drop these columns, as they won't contain any values and they will only clutter our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The `source` column appears to be more wordy than it needs to be, i.e. do we actually need the hyperlink since it appears that this column is chiefly about identifying how the tweet was sent, i.e. from an iphone, the website or via another app?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The `text` column is actually a concatination of the tweet text, followed by the dog's rating, then a shortened hyperlink to the actual tweet itself on twitter. The rating has been split into the `rating_numerator` and `rating_denominator` columns. The full hyperlink has been expanded in the `expanded_urls` column. We could extract just the text part to isolate it and make it tidy, but unless we need this later in our analysis, this doesn't appear necessary at this time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Sometimes the `expanded_urls` column contains more than one URL and scanning through them visually, they always appear to be duplicates. After opening up these URLs in a browser, it seems like there are duplicates when there is more than 1 photo in the tweet. However, these are not the URLs for the images, they are links to the original tweet itself. Unless we are going to be doing analysis on this column, fixing this issue doesn't seem to be a priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The `rating_denominator` column has at least one value that is not 10. Recall that ratings are supposed to be some number \"out of 10.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The `name` column doesn't always contain a name. For example, there are words like \"a\" and \"such\" indicating that the extraction of the dog's name from the tweet text was not perfect. Also, there are \"None\" values.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The `doggo`, `floofer`, `pupper`, and `puppo` columns contain many \"None\" values. If the value is not \"None\", then it is simply a repeat of the column name. Also, it appears that either all of these columns within a given row are \"None,\" or if not, then there is at most one of the four that is not \"None.\" This is very untidy. These columns represent WeRateDog's unique  \"dog stages\" (i.e. what stage of life a dog is in). Since these columns all ultimately represent one variable, they should be merged into one `dog_stage` column.\n",

    "Merging columns just screams for using the pandas [\"melt\" function](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.melt.html). We pick our set of columns to be used as the \"id\" for each row (this will be all of the columns that we're not merging or \"melting\" together), as well as the four that we are melting together (these are the \"values\"). This will reduce our four columns down to two: one for the original column name (the \"variable\") and one for it its \"value.\" Note that in our case this will create four rows for each tweet id. We don't need the \"variable\" column, so we can drop that. Now, if only we could we could easily pick the one of these four rows that we need to keep. Fortunately, the Panda's sort_values function can help. Becuase it will sort capitalized words before uncapitalized ones, we will easily be able to identify a non-\"None\" value if one exists, as it will be the last one after sorting. Then all we need to do is to drop the preceding rows. As we saw in the Assess section above, there is the rare case where there is actually more than one dog stage. In this case we will chose the one that gets sorted to the last position.\n",
