    "This project is from Udacity's Data Wrangling course, which is part of the Data Analyst Nanodegree program. Using Python and its libraries, we will gather data from a variety of sources and different formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. That, is we will perform data wrangling. These efforts will be documented in this Jupyter Notebook in order showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.\n",

    "This project involves downloading a twitter archive and supplementing it with additional data. Accoring to the Udacity course materials:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The dataset that we will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because \"they're good dogs Brent.\" WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "> WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017."
