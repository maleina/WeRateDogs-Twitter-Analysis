This is called data wrangling. We will document these wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, then showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.\n",

    "The dataset that we will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because \"they're good dogs Brent.\" WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.\n",
